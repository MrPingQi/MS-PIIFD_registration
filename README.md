# MS-PIIFD_registration
Code for the paper “Multi-scale PIIFD for registration of multi-source remote sensing images” [Online]. Available: http://journal.bit.edu.cn/jbit/en/article/doi/10.15918/j.jbit1004-0579.2021.016. and “Multi-Scale HARRIS-PIIFD Features for Registration of Visible and Infrared Images” [Online].

If you are from China, just speak Chinese, its OK~  中国人直接说中文就可以了~

Run this code by the following procedures:

1. Open and run "A_registration_main.m".
2. Set the parameters, if the procedures are clearly understood. Otherwise, use the default.
3. Choose the reference image.
4. Choose the sensed image.
5. Wait for the results.

** Now this registration algorithm is an old-fashioned one, and we highly recommend checking our new method: MS-HLMO, which is now available at https://github.com/MrPingQi/MS_HLMO_registration.
